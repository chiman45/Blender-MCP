    "content": "As a large language model, I don't have access to or use \"MCP tools\" or Claude AI in the way a developer would.\n\nHere's why and what that means:\n\n* **I am trained by Google.** My knowledge and abilities are based on the data and models developed by Google. I am not built upon or directly integrated with other AI models like Claude.\n* **No Direct Access to External Tools:** I don't have the capability to directly interact with external AI services or toolkits. I don't \"run\" Claude AI or any similar tool.\n* **How I Utilize Knowledge:** My training data includes information about a vast range of topics, including different AI models.  I can *describe* Claude AI, *compare* it to other models, and *discuss* its features and capabilities based on what I have learned from my training data. However, I can't *use* it to perform tasks.\n\n**In short, I can talk *about* Claude AI, but I can't *use* it.**\n\nThink of it like this: I can describe how a car engine works in detail, but I can't actually start an engine and drive a car.\n"
